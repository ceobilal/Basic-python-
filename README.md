<h1>Escape Sequence Character in python</h1>
<p>Escape Characters are special characters in Python <a href="http://github.com/ceobilal/Basic-python-/blob/main/00_Escape%20Character%20in%20python.py"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Escape Sequence Character Example</a></p>
<pre>| Escape Character | Meaning          |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| \n             | New line         |
| \t             | Tab (space)      |
| \\             | Backslash itself |
| \'             | Single quote     |
| \"             | Double quote     |
</pre>
<h1>Python Comments</h1>
<p> They are used only to explain the code or leave notes for humans. Comments are not interpreted by Python. Meaining, Comments will not be executed.<br/>
There are Two Types Comments <br/> (1) single line Comments <br/> (2) Double line Comments <br/>
  Example in this link <a href="https://github.com/ceobilal/Basic-python-/blob/main/01%20Python%20Comments.py">Comments Example.</a>

<h1>What is Variables in Python</h1>
<p> Variables are containers for storing data values.<br/>
<h2>Rules for naming variables:</h2>
  1: A Variable name should start with a latter or undrscoure ( _ ). <br/>
  2: A Variable name Cannot Start With a number. <br/>
  3: A Variable name is Case sensitive. <br/>
  4: A variable name should only Contain Underscores ( _ ) and alpha-numeric Character. <br/>

</p>
<h1>Python Data Types</h1>
<p> Variables can store data of different types. Python has some built-in data types, and they come in different categories<br/> In This is Example Check the data type <a href="https://github.com/ceobilal/Basic-python-/blob/main/03%20Python%20Check%20data%20Type.py">Example No 1</a> <br/> In This Example (str,int,float,complex) <a href="https://github.com/ceobilal/Basic-python-/blob/main/04%20Python%20Data%20Types.py">Example No 2</a> .</p>

<h1>Type Casting in Python</h1>
<pre>Type Casting is the process of converting one data type into another in Python.
integer to float 
flot to integer
string to integer
integer to float
etc.   <a href="https://github.com/ceobilal/Basic-python-/blob/main/05%20Python%20Type%20Casting.py">Example </a></pre>
<h1>Python Strings / Strings Methods</h1>
<p>
A String in Python is a sequence of characters, used to represent text data.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;1: Strings can contain letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;2: In Python, strings are written inside single ' ' or double " " quotes.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;3: Strings are immutable, which means once created, you cannot change them directly.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;4: String Writing methods <a href="https://github.com/ceobilal/Basic-python-/blob/main/06%20Python%20Strings%20and%20Strings%20Methods.py">Example</a>
</p>

<h1>String Array in Python ?</h1>
<p>Each character can be accessed by its index <a href="https://github.com/ceobilal/Basic-python-/blob/main/07%20Python%20Strings%20are%20Arrays.py"> Example </a></p>
<h1>Input our Output in Python </h1>
<P>Input = User gives something <br/>
Output = Program shows something &nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="https://github.com/ceobilal/Basic-python-/blob/main/08%20Python%20input%20and%20output.py"> Example </a></P>
<h1>Python List </h1>
<p>
<h2>What is a Python List? </h2> 
In Python, a list is an ordered container â€” meaning the items inside it are stored in a specific sequence.<br/>
In Python, lists allow us to store multiple items in a single variable.<br/>
For example, if you need to store the ages of all the students in a class, you can easily do this using a list.<br/>
<h2>How to Create List</h2>
To create a list, we use square brackets [ ].<br/>
All the items you want to store are written inside these brackets,<br/>
and each item is separated by a comma ( , ).<br/>
<pre>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]</pre>
<h2>List Items of Different Types</h2>
Python lists are very flexible.<br/>
We can store items of different data types in a single list.<br/>
For example:
You can keep numbers, words (strings), and True or False (boolean values) all together in one list.<br/> <br/>
Lists are somewhat similar to arrays in other programming languages,
but the difference is that Python lists are dynamic arrays â€” meaning they can hold items of different data types (such as numbers, strings, or booleans) together.
<h2>Access List Elements</h2>
When we create a list, each item inside it is automatically given a number,<br/>
called an index.
<h2>What is an Index?</h2>
An index is a number that tells us the position of an item in the list.<br/><br/>

1. The first item in a list is always at index 0.<br/>
2. The second item is at index 1.<br/>
3. The third item is at index 2, and so on.<br/>Example.
<pre>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango", "grapes"]</pre>
<pre>| Item     | Index |
| -------- | ----- |
| "apple"  | 0     |
| "banana" | 1     |
| "mango"  | 2     |
| "grapes" | 3     |
</pre>
<h2>Negative Indexing (Accessing items from the end of a list)</h2>

In Python, you can access items from the end of a list using negative numbers.
â€¢	The last item has index -1
â€¢	The second last item has index -2
â€¢	The third last item has index -3,
and so on.
  <pre>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango", "grapes"]</pre>
  <pre>
    | Item   | Positive Index | Negative Index |
| ------ | -------------- | -------------- |
| apple  | 0              | -4             |
| banana | 1              | -3             |
| mango  | 2              | -2             |
| grapes | 3              | -1             |
  </pre>
<h2>What is a Nested List?</h2>
A Nested List is a list that contains other lists inside it.<br/>
The outer list is called the parent list, and the inner lists are called child lists.
<pre>
  Example:
         matrix = [
                     [1, 2, 3],
                     [4, 5, 6],
                     [7, 8, 9]
                                ]
</pre>
<h2>ðŸ”¹ What is List Slicing? \ Range of Indexes?</h2>
If we want to get a portion of a list, instead of the whole list,<br/>
we can use the slicing operator : in Python.<br/><br/> 
Using slicing, we can specify the start and end indexes of the list to get only that part.
<h3> Range of Index</h3> By using a colon (:) we can access a range of items at once.<br/> Simply separate two indexes useing the colon.<br/> The first index is the start of the range while the second index is the end of the range  <br/>

<pre>         
     Example:
               numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
                     print(numbers[1:4]) Output: [20, 30, 40]
                     numbers[:3]  # 0 Ø³Û’ 2 index ØªÚ©  Output: [20, 30, 40]
</pre>
<h2>Negative slicing</h2> 
<pre>                     
        Example:
                        numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
                            print(numbers[-4:-1])   Output:  [20, 30, 40]
                            print (number[:-4]) Output: [10] 
</pre>
