<h1> What is Progarming Language </h1>
<p> A Programming Language is a Special Language that we Use to tell the Computer What to do. </p>

<h1>What is Python </h1>
<p>Python is a popular and easy programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. Python is case sensitive Programming language.</p>
<pre>
<h2>It is used for:</h2>
1. web development (server-side),
2. software development,
3. mathematics,
4. system scripting,
5. AI/ML,
6. Data science,
7. automation,
9. data analysis,
10. game development,
11. desktop applications,
12. cyber security,
13. network programming,
14. IoT (Internet of Things),
15. scientific computing,
16  machine learning,
17. deep learning,
etc.

<h1>Python Comments</h1>
<p> They are used only to explain the code or leave notes for humans. Comments are not interpreted by Python. Meaining, Comments will not be executed.<br/>
There are Two Types Comments <br/> (1) single line Comments <br/> (2) Double line Comments <br/>
  Example in this link <a href="https://github.com/ceobilal/Basic-python-/blob/main/01%20Python%20Comments.py">Comments Example.</a>

<h1>What is Variables in Python</h1>
<p> Variables are containers for storing data values.<br/>
<h2>Rules for naming variables:</h2>
  1: A Variable name should start with a latter or undrscoure ( _ ). <br/>
  2: A Variable name Cannot Start With a number. <br/>
  3: A Variable name is Case sensitive. <br/>
  4: A variable name should only Contain Underscores ( _ ) and alpha-numeric Character. <br/>

</p>
<h1>Python Data Types</h1>
<p> Variables can store data of different types. Python has some built-in data types, and they come in different categories<br/> In This is Example Check the data type <a href="https://github.com/ceobilal/Basic-python-/blob/main/03%20Python%20Check%20data%20Type.py">Example No 1</a> <br/> In This Example (str,int,float,complex) <a href="https://github.com/ceobilal/Basic-python-/blob/main/04%20Python%20Data%20Types.py">Example No 2</a> .</p>
<pre>
<h2>Python Built-in Data Types</h2>
Category           Data Types
-----------------  ----------------------------
Text Type          str ✅
Numeric Types      int ✅, float ✅, complex
Sequence Types     list ✅, tuple ✅, range
Mapping Type       dict✅
Set Types          set✅, frozenset
Boolean Type       bool✅
Binary Types       bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type          NoneType✅

<h1>Type Casting in Python</h1>
<pre>Type Casting is the process of converting one data type into another in Python.
integer to float 
flot to integer
string to integer
integer to float
etc.   <a href="https://github.com/ceobilal/Basic-python-/blob/main/05%20Python%20Type%20Casting.py">Example </a></pre>
<h1>Python Strings / Strings Methods</h1>
<p>
A String in Python is a sequence of characters, used to represent text data.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;1: Strings can contain letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;2: In Python, strings are written inside single ' ' or double " " quotes.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;3: Strings are immutable, which means once created, you cannot change them directly.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;4: String Writing methods <a href="https://github.com/ceobilal/Basic-python-/blob/main/06%20Python%20Strings.py">Example</a>
</p>

<h1>String Array in Python ?</h1>
<p>Each character can be accessed by its index <a href="https://github.com/ceobilal/Basic-python-/blob/main/07%20Python%20Strings%20are%20Arrays.py"> Example </a></p>
<h1>Input our Output in Python </h1>
<P>Input = User gives something <br/>
Output = Program shows something &nbsp; &nbsp;  <a href="https://github.com/ceobilal/Basic-python-/blob/main/08%20Python%20input%20and%20output.py"> Example </a></P>
